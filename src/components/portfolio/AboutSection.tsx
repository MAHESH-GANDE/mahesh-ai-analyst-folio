                    My career began in campaign analysis, where I discovered the power of data to tell compelling stories 
                    and drive business decisions. Working with diverse clients, I've developed expertise in translating 
                    complex datasets into clear, actionable insights that directly impact bottom-line results.

                    What sets me apart is my ability to bridge the gap between technical analysis and business strategy. 
                    I don't just crunch numbersâ€”I uncover the narrative within the data and present findings in ways that 
                    stakeholders can immediately understand and act upon.

                  <p>
                    Currently, I'm expanding my expertise into advanced data analytics and AI, earning Microsoft certifications 
                    and working on cutting-edge projects that leverage GenAI for enhanced analytics workflows. My goal is to 
                    become a leader in data-driven decision making, combining traditional analytics with emerging AI technologies.
